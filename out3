Title Advanced C%Science Programming Techniques
Description This is a course about the practice of programming. Programming is more than just writing code. Programmers must also assess tradeoffs, choose among design alternatives, debug and test, improve performance, and maintain software written by themselves & others. At the same time, they must be concerned with compatibility, robustness, and reliability, while meeting specifications. Students will have the opportunity to develop these skills by working on their own code and in group projects.
Prerequisites COS 217 and COS 226.

Title Topics in the Intellectual History of Modern and Contemporary Spain: Culture and Memory of the Spanish Civil War
Description An examination of the narrative, poetry, film, songs, photography and graphic art generated by Spaniards and foreigners about the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) in the seventy years since the war was fought. This cultural production will be examined in the context of the political and ideological reasons that explain the international attraction the war generated. Among the works examined: poems by Neruda; Picasso's Guernica (it was the first war in which aviation played a significant role); documentaries (The Spanish Earth, Mourir a Madrid); and photographs by Robert Capa (the Spanish Civil War consecrated the nascent art of photojournalism).
Prerequisites At least one SPA 200-level course (two 200-level SPA courses advisable) or instructor's permission.

Title American Economic History
Description Modern economic theory is used to analyze growth and fluctuations in U.S. output from colonial times to the present. The course examines the role of labor markets, property rights in land and labor, financial institutions, transportation, innovation and other factors in economic growth. Before examining twentieth century fluctuations, a week is spent on business cycle theory. Then particular emphasis is placed on The Great Depression and its relationship to the recession of 2007-2009.
Prerequisites ECO 100 and ECO 101. These are firm prerequisites, NOT co-requisites. This course counts towards WWS disciplinary perspectives requirement.

Title Topics in International Relations: US Diplomacy & the Other Middle East
Description Seminar examines the political, social, economic and strategic dynamics within "The Other Middle East": the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council and their primary neighbors, Iraq, Iran, Yemen and India. Course explores the context and complexities of the regional actors, how recent US policies have affected these states and the impact of the Iraq War on the region and on US influence and options. Topics include the role of religion, the growth of knowledge-based globalized economies, public diplomacy; the history of Saudi-Iranian relations, and the rise of regional actors, particularly Iran and India.

Title Introduction to Cellular and Molecular Biology
Description Important concepts and elements of molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, and cell biology, are examined in the context of classic experiments. During the last four weeks of the semester, the class will split into topic-based sections taught by different faculty members in the following areas: cell biology, biochemistry, neuroscience, microbiology, and development. Students will choose to concentrate in 2 of the 6 sections. This course is strongly recommended for students intending to major in the biological sciences and satisfies the biology requirement for entrance into medical school.
Prerequisites Open to undergraduate students only. Graduate students and auditors must have permission of instructor.

Title The Power and Peril of Cycling Cells
Description Accurate control of cell cycle is essential for the formation and maintenance of a normal living organism. This course will study the molecular machinery that controls the cell cycle and the devastating consequence of its de-regulation that leads to cancer. We begin with a mechanistic examination of the cell cycle in bacteria, yeast, flies and mammals. We then consider cell cycle and cell size, and the cell cycle of stem cells. We will also discuss the oncogenic events that disrupt the normal cell cycle, the signaling pathways that activate uncontrolled cell proliferation, and the molecular therapeutics that target oncogenic pathways.

Title Intercellular Signaling and Signal Transduction
Description Explores the interactions of cells with their surroundings at a molecular and cell biological level. It begins with an introduction to a number of basic signal transduction pathways, a characterization of their respective receptors and the molecular pathways that communicate between the cell surface and the nucleus. Discusses how signaling establishes axes of cell polarity and migratory pathways by producing changes in the cytoskeleton, and how cells interact with extracellular matrix molecules. Addresses the cell's response to nutritional cues and other extracellular signals that influence cell growth, cell division and cell physiology.

Title History of Anthropological Theory
Description This course is an introduction to fundamental theories and debates in social/cultural anthropology. We will examine the national and colonial origins of anthropology, considering how western encounters with non-western peoples in the 19th-20th centuries opened questions about human kinship, history, economy, religion, language, sexuality, and personhood that continue to shape the horizons of our thought today. We will study this inheritance critically, exploring the changing concepts, methods, and ethics of anthropological research and writing, and evaluate their bearing on questions of power, justice, and identity in the present.
Prerequisites ANT 201 or instructor's permission. Non-majors will also need instructor's permission to enroll.
