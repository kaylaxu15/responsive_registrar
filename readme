Kayla: I worked on the searchresults.html file: I adapted the logic from our last assignment
to query from the database and get the correct information to display to the single page. I
also implemented the debouncedGetResults and getting the JSON response and making AJAX requests 
for the actual course information. I also worked on the modal for classdetails and also handled
the AJAX querying logic to get the classdetails information. I used Mustache templates for both
the class overviews page and the class details modal pop-up.
